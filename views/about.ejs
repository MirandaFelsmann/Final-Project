    <p>War. is a simulation game based off of World War I. This game pits country against country in a struggle for power across a vast region. Alliances, negotiations, and distribution of the spoils of victory are all essential to staying alive in the game. But beware...not even alliances are safe from sabotage.</p>

            <p>Meet the Web Dev</p>
            <p>This game was moved online in order to try and streamline the game process and rules. This effort was my culminating project for my enrollment in the 2023â€“2024 FullStack class. I've worked closely with the history department on several occasions, including to run the game for this year's 10th graders, and so this project felt like a natural choice.</p>
